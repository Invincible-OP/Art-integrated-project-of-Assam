        <p>Assam is the largest of the north-eastern states in India. It has a bustling agrarian economy. Tea is the
            major crop that drives Assam's economic growth. It accounts for nearly 15% of the world's production of tea
            and around 50% of India's production of tea. More than 40% of the state's income comes from agriculture.
            Nearly 70% of the state's population depends on agriculture for employment. <br><br>

            Besides rice (the primary food crop), cash crops like tea, cotton, jute, oilseeds, sugarcane and potato are
            grown in the state. Also grown on a small scale are crops such as coconut, orange, guava, banana, pineapple,
            areca nut, mango and jackfruit. Though primarily dependent on agriculture, the literacy rate of the Assamese
            population is 70%, close to the national average of literacy . <br><br>

            Aside from its share in world tea production, Assam (Digboi) also holds the distinction of being the oil hub
            of India. (Digboi). Petroleum oil was discovered in Digboi during the British rule in the late 19th
            century.It is today a major headquarters of the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) today. <br><br></p>

        <p>Agriculture is the main occupation of the people in Assam. It accounts for 63 per cent of the state's
            workforce. The farmers engage in the cultivation of rice, which is the staple diet of Assamese people. Other
            agricultural crops include pulses, jute, tea and fruit cultivation.<br><br>
            Assam is well known for its tea plantation all over the world and the tea gardens of Assam provide
            employment to nearly a million people. Assam's tea plantation forms 15 per cent of the world's tea output.
            The major
            revenueof the people IN Assam is due to the forests. Timber and bamboo are the prime products from the
            forests of
            Assam and the production of these involves many people. Besides cultivation, weaving is another major
            occupation
            in Assam. The Assamese women practise weaving as an occupation. The state is known for the production of
            silk
            material, tussar and other fabrics. The industries of wood products and food also provide occupation to
            many.<br><br>
            Assam's beauty like the rest of the Seven Sisters is unique but neglected. We tend to forget that there is a
            little paradise in our own country waiting to be explored. Assam with its ecstatic frenzy has always
            enraptured
            its visitors .
